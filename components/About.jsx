            Hello! my name is Julio and I'm a Full-Stack web developer ðŸ’» and electronic engineer bachelor âš¡. 
            After a year of experience as an electronic engineer, I decided to take a leap into the technology industry as I found myself drawn to
            the world of web development. For this reason, I joined Codeable, a full stack web development bootcamp to start my path in this
            field. Currently, I am looking for a full stack or front-end development position to continue improving and strengthening my skills.
